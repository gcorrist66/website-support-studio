# WSS Phase 5 Gate Tracker

## 1) Current Phase Status
- Current focus: Phase 5A (Live Read-Only Supabase Data Integration)
- Authority: local UI read-only proof only
- Deployment status: not deployed
- Push status: not pushed
- Auth: not implemented
- Customer communication: not implemented
- Mutations: not implemented

## 2) Phase 5A — Live Read-Only Supabase Data Integration
- Diagnosed: complete
- Fixed Locally: complete
- Committed: complete
- Pushed: not complete
- Deployed: not complete
- Production Verified: not complete
- Closed: not complete

### Evidence
- Added read-only data helper layer: `src/data/readOnlyTicketData.ts`.
- Added mode detection with explicit guard:
  - `WSS_ALLOW_SUPABASE_VALIDATION=dev`
  - `WSS_SUPABASE_ENVIRONMENT` in `{dev,development,local}`
  - `WSS_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=\"vrtfbbrwrxyljchywmzy\"`
  - Supabase URL host includes expected dev project ref and `supabase.co`
  - Uses only anon-style key candidates; service-role key usage is blocked by guard.
- Implemented read paths only:
  - `getReadOnlyTicketQueue`
  - `getReadOnlyTicketDetail`
  - `getReadOnlyTicketAuditTimeline`
- Added mock fallback paths for all read helpers when guard conditions are not met.
- Updated `AppShell` to use adapter and show read-only mode label.
- Added validation script `scripts/validate-readonly-data.mjs`.
- Added npm script `validate:readonly-data`.
- Updated `src/components/shell/AppShell.tsx` to load queue/detail/audit from `src/data/readOnlyTicketData.ts` with guarded live-read fallback.
- Added `getReadOnlyApprovalQueue` helper for approved/awaiting-approval queue support and safe mode fallback.
- Added local read-only checks to `scripts/validate-readonly-data.mjs`.
- Updated phase boundary validation script `scripts/validate-ui-boundary.mjs` for phase naming in disabled-action copy checks.
- Validation output (all pass) for:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run validate:domain`
  - `npm run validate:e2e`
  - `npm run validate:phase2a`
  - `npm run validate:persistence`
  - `npm run validate:contracts`
  - `npm run validate:handlers`
  - `npm run validate:route-boundary`
  - `npm run validate:ui-boundary`
  - `npm run validate:readonly-data`
- Constraint checks:
  - Reads only in `src/data/readOnlyTicketData.ts` (queue/detail/audit).
  - No mutations, no writes, no approvals or close/send logic invoked.
  - Live read path requires guarded validation mode and anon key, with mock fallback for missing/failed reads.
  - No service-role key references in UI/browser source.

### Phase 5A Hardening Pass
- Completed targeted read-only boundary hardening checks:
  - `scripts/validate-readonly-data.mjs` now enforces:
    - no `insert/update/delete/upsert/rpc` calls in `src/data/readOnlyTicketData.ts`
    - explicit mock fallback branches are present
    - anon-env-only client key usage (service-role key names rejected)
    - no customer communication/provider phrases in read-only layer + AppShell
  - `scripts/validate-ui-boundary.mjs` now enforces no service-role token references in UI source.
  - Added explicit checks for no service-role exposure, explicit mock fallback assertions, and customer communication absence.
- Validation commands rerun:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run validate:domain`
  - `npm run validate:e2e`
  - `npm run validate:phase2a`
  - `npm run validate:persistence`
  - `npm run validate:contracts`
  - `npm run validate:handlers`
  - `npm run validate:route-boundary`
  - `npm run validate:ui-boundary`
  - `npm run validate:readonly-data`
- Outcome: all commands pass; no browser/service-role leakage, no mutating calls in read-only data layer, and UI still remains read-only/disconnected.

### Constraints checked for Phase 5A
- Queue/detail/audit reads are sourced only through helper functions in `src/data`.
- No insert/update/delete/upsert call sites were introduced in the read-only data helper file.
- No API route files were added.
- No live mutations/handlers were wired into UI actions (disabled placeholders only).

## 3) Previous Gate Notes
- Phase 4D remains the local mock UI baseline.
- This phase should not include API routes, auth, ticket mutations, communication integrations, or deploy behavior.
